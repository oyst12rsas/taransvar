Setup notes...
- Router should have public IP. Port shown by honey.php will not be correct if there's NAT between.
- Make sure the external and internal IP shown by ifconfig are the one stored in dashboard Setup (http://localhost)
- run misc/setup_network.pl to set up Ubuntu24 for routing
- Re-run taralink if you make changes to Servers, Partner, Infection, Inspections. For others, also re-run tarakernel.
- Make sure cron jobs are running. To see/edit: sudo crontab -u root -e 

Misc:
- sudo dmesg | grep urg_ptr to check use of urg_ptr

Demo:
- honey.php (requires public ip or two VPS running)
- tagging (don't see outbound tagging)
- blacklisting? (b/w listing not yet updated)
